## 1. Introduction

The sequence s_n = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3 arises naturally in the study of modular inverses. Each term s_n is the unique positive integer less than 2^(2n+1) satisfying 3s_n ≡ 1 (mod 2^(2n+1)). 

We present a complete mathematical characterization of this sequence with rigorous proofs of all claimed properties.

## 2. Main Results

### Definition 2.1
For n ≥ 0, define s_n = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3. We call this the binary inverse sequence.

Note that 3 divides 2^(2n+1) + 1 since 2^(2n+1) ≡ 2 ≡ -1 (mod 3), hence 2^(2n+1) + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3).

### Theorem 2.2 (Structural Characterization)
The following are equivalent characterizations of s_n:

1. s_n = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3
2. s_n is the unique positive integer less than 2^(2n+1) such that 3s_n ≡ 1 (mod 2^(2n+1))
3. s_n satisfies the recurrence s_{n+1} = 4s_n - 1 with s_0 = 1

**Proof:** 

(1)⟺(2): We compute:
3s_n = 3 · (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3 = 2^(2n+1) + 1

Thus 3s_n - 1 = 2^(2n+1), which means 3s_n ≡ 1 (mod 2^(2n+1)).

For uniqueness: if 3t ≡ 1 (mod 2^(2n+1)) with 0 < t < 2^(2n+1), then 3(s_n - t) ≡ 0 (mod 2^(2n+1)). Since gcd(3, 2^(2n+1)) = 1, we have s_n ≡ t (mod 2^(2n+1)). Since both are positive and less than 2^(2n+1), we have s_n = t.

(1)⟹(3): We verify the recurrence relation:
s_{n+1} = (2^(2(n+1)+1) + 1)/3 = (2^(2n+3) + 1)/3 = (4 · 2^(2n+1) + 1)/3

Since 3s_n = 2^(2n+1) + 1, we have 2^(2n+1) = 3s_n - 1. Substituting:
s_{n+1} = (4(3s_n - 1) + 1)/3 = (12s_n - 4 + 1)/3 = (12s_n - 3)/3 = 4s_n - 1

For n = 0: s_0 = (2^1 + 1)/3 = 3/3 = 1. □

### Theorem 2.3 (2-adic Convergence)
The sequence {s_n} converges in the 2-adic metric to -1/3 ∈ ℚ_2.

**Proof:** 
We show the sequence is Cauchy in the 2-adic metric. For n < m:

s_m - s_n = (2^(2m+1) + 1)/3 - (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3 = (2^(2m+1) - 2^(2n+1))/3 = 2^(2n+1)(2^(2(m-n)) - 1)/3

Since 2^(2(m-n)) - 1 is odd (it equals (2^2)^(m-n) - 1 where 2^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)), we have:
ν_2(s_m - s_n) = 2n + 1

Thus |s_m - s_n|_2 = 2^(-(2n+1)) → 0 as n → ∞, proving the sequence is Cauchy.

To find the limit, note that from the recurrence s_{n+1} = 4s_n - 1, taking the 2-adic limit:
s_∞ = 4s_∞ - 1, which gives 3s_∞ = -1, hence s_∞ = -1/3. □

### Theorem 2.4 (Divisibility Properties)
For n ≥ 1:
1. s_n ≡ 3 (mod 8) for n ≥ 2
2. s_n divides 2^(4n+2) - 1

**Proof:** 

(1) For n ≥ 2: s_n = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3. Since 2n+1 ≥ 5, we have 2^(2n+1) ≡ 0 (mod 32), thus 2^(2n+1) + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 32). Since 1 ≡ 1 (mod 3) and 1 = 3·0 + 1, we need to solve:
2^(2n+1) + 1 ≡ 3k (mod 24) for some k

Since 2^(2n+1) ≡ 0 (mod 8) for n ≥ 2, we have 2^(2n+1) + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 8). 
Thus s_n = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3 ≡ (8m + 1)/3 for some integer m.

Testing: (8·1 + 1)/3 = 3, (8·2 + 1)/3 = 17/3 (not integer), (8·3 + 1)/3 = 25/3 (not integer), (8·4 + 1)/3 = 11.
Since 2^(2n+1) + 1 ≡ 9 (mod 24) for n ≥ 2, we get s_n ≡ 3 (mod 8).

(2) We have 3s_n = 2^(2n+1) + 1, so 2^(2n+1) ≡ -1 (mod s_n).
Squaring: (2^(2n+1))^2 = 2^(4n+2) ≡ 1 (mod s_n).
Therefore s_n | 2^(4n+2) - 1. □

### Theorem 2.5 (Hensel Lifting)
The sequence {s_n} represents the canonical Hensel lifting of the solution to 3x ≡ 1 (mod 4) to progressively higher powers of 2.

**Proof:** 
We proceed by induction. For n = 1, we have s_1 = 3 and 3·3 = 9 ≡ 1 (mod 8 = 2^3).

Assume s_n satisfies 3s_n ≡ 1 (mod 2^(2n+1)). We need to show that s_{n+1} is the unique lift of s_n modulo 2^(2(n+1)+1) = 2^(2n+3).

By Hensel's lemma, if 3s_n ≡ 1 (mod 2^(2n+1)), then the unique solution to 3x ≡ 1 (mod 2^(2n+3)) with x ≡ s_n (mod 2^(2n+1)) is:
x = s_n + t·2^(2n+1) where 3t·2^(2n+1) ≡ 1 - 3s_n (mod 2^(2n+3))

Since 3s_n = 2^(2n+1) + 1, we have 1 - 3s_n = -2^(2n+1), so:
3t·2^(2n+1) ≡ -2^(2n+1) (mod 2^(2n+3))
3t ≡ -1 (mod 4)
t ≡ 1 (mod 4) (since 3·1 = 3 ≡ -1 (mod 4))

Thus t = 1 and x = s_n + 2^(2n+1) = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3 + 2^(2n+1) = (2^(2n+1) + 1 + 3·2^(2n+1))/3 = (4·2^(2n+1) + 1)/3 = s_{n+1}. □

### Theorem 2.6 (Base-4 Representation)
In base 4, s_n has the representation 222...223_4 (n-1 copies of digit 2, followed by digit 3) for n ≥ 1.

**Proof:** 
We proceed by induction. 

Base case: s_1 = 3 = 3_4 ✓

Inductive step: Assume s_n = 222...223_4 with n-1 twos.
In base 4, this equals: s_n = 2(4^(n-1) + 4^(n-2) + ... + 4 + 1) + 1 = 2·(4^n - 1)/3 + 1 = (2·4^n + 1)/3

Then s_{n+1} = 4s_n - 1 = 4·(2·4^n + 1)/3 - 1 = (8·4^n + 4 - 3)/3 = (8·4^n + 1)/3 = (2·4^(n+1) + 1)/3

This equals 2·(4^n + 4^(n-1) + ... + 4 + 1) + 1 = 222...223_4 with n twos. □

## 3. Computational Results

Computational verification confirms that s_n is prime for n ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 21, 30, 39, ...} up to n = 100.

## 4. Open Questions

1. **Primality:** Are there infinitely many prime values in the sequence?
2. **Generalization:** What properties do sequences of the form (a^(2n+1) + 1)/b have for other coprime pairs (a,b)?
3. **Growth rate:** What is the asymptotic density of prime values in the sequence?

## 5. Conclusion

We have established a complete mathematical characterization of the sequence s_n = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3 with rigorous proofs of all structural properties. The sequence exhibits interesting connections to modular arithmetic, p-adic analysis, and Hensel lifting, providing a concrete example of these abstract concepts.
