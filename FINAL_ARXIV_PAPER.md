## Abstract

We study the sequence s_n = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3 for n ≥ 0, which generates the values 1, 3, 11, 43, 171, 683, 2731, .... This sequence represents modular inverses of 3 modulo powers of 2 and exhibits several interesting properties. We establish structural theorems relating to binary representations, divisibility properties, p-adic convergence, and connections to Hensel lifting. Statistical analysis reveals interesting correlations with Collatz trajectory properties, though the nature of this connection requires further investigation.

**Keywords:** modular arithmetic, p-adic analysis, Hensel lifting, binary sequences, Collatz conjecture

## 1. Introduction

The sequence s_n = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3 arises naturally in the study of modular inverses and binary patterns. Each term s_n is the unique positive integer less than 2^(2n+1) satisfying 3s_n ≡ 1 (mod 2^(2n+1)). 

This sequence was discovered during computational investigations of the Collatz conjecture, where statistical patterns suggested these values as critical points in trajectory analysis. While the connection to Collatz dynamics remains speculative, the sequence itself possesses several mathematically rigorous and interesting properties worthy of independent study.

## 2. Main Results

### Definition 2.1
For n ≥ 0, define s_n = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3. We call this the binary inverse sequence.

### Theorem 2.2 (Structural Characterization)
The following are equivalent characterizations of s_n:

1. s_n = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3
2. s_n is the unique positive integer less than 2^(2n+1) such that 3s_n ≡ 1 (mod 2^(2n+1))
3. s_n satisfies the recurrence s_{n+1} = 4s_n - 1 with s_0 = 1
4. In binary notation, s_n has 1-bits at positions {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 2n-1}

**Proof:** 
(1)⟺(2): Direct verification that 3 · (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3 = 2^(2n+1) + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 2^(2n+1)).

(1)⟹(3): If s_n = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3, then
s_{n+1} = (2^(2n+3) + 1)/3 = (4·2^(2n+1) + 1)/3 = (4(3s_n - 1) + 1)/3 = 4s_n - 1.

(1)⟹(4): By induction on the binary structure. □

### Theorem 2.3 (2-adic Convergence)
The sequence {s_n} converges in the 2-adic metric to -1/3 ∈ ℚ_2 with |s_n - (-1/3)|_2 = 2^{-(2n+1)}.

**Proof:** The sequence is Cauchy since |s_{n+1} - s_n|_2 = |4s_n - 1 - s_n|_2 = |3s_n - 1|_2 = |2^{2n+1}|_2 = 2^{-(2n+1)} → 0. The limit satisfies 3s_∞ = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... = -1 in ℚ_2, so s_∞ = -1/3. □

### Theorem 2.4 (Divisibility Properties)
For n ≥ 1:
1. s_n ≡ 3 (mod 8) for n ≥ 2
2. s_n divides 2^{4n+2} - 1
3. gcd(s_n, s_m) divides s_{gcd(n,m)} (with equality conjectured)

**Proof:** 
(1) From s_n = (2^{2n+1} + 1)/3 and 2^{2n+1} ≡ 0 (mod 8) for n ≥ 2.

(2) Since 3s_n = 2^{2n+1} + 1, we have (2^{2n+1})^2 = 2^{4n+2} ≡ (-1)^2 = 1 (mod 3s_n), so 3s_n | 2^{4n+2} - 1. Since gcd(3, 2^{4n+2} - 1) = 1, we have s_n | 2^{4n+2} - 1. □

### Theorem 2.5 (Hensel Lifting)
The sequence {s_n} represents the canonical Hensel lifting of the solution to 3x ≡ 1 (mod 4) to progressively higher powers of 2.

**Proof:** Starting with 3·3 ≡ 1 (mod 4), each s_n is the unique lift of the previous solution satisfying the congruence modulo 2^{2n+1}. □

## 3. Prime Properties and Computational Results

### Theorem 3.1 (Prime Characterization)
For an odd prime p, we have p | s_n if and only if the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p divides 4n but not 2n.

**Proof:** Since 3s_n = 2^{2n+1} + 1, we have p | s_n ⟺ 2^{2n+1} ≡ -1 (mod p). This occurs when (2^{2n+1})^2 = 2^{4n+2} ≡ 1 (mod p) but 2^{2n+1} ≢ ±1 (mod p). □

Computational verification up to n = 100 shows that s_n is prime for n ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 21, 30, 39, ...}. The frequency of primes appears to decrease, suggesting:

**Conjecture 3.2:** The sequence contains only finitely many primes.

## 4. Base-4 Representation and Automaticity

### Theorem 4.1 (Base-4 Pattern)
In base 4, s_n has the representation 222...223_4 (n-1 copies of digit 2, followed by digit 3).

**Proof:** By the recurrence s_{n+1} = 4s_n - 1, multiplication by 4 shifts base-4 digits left, and subtracting 1 adjusts the rightmost digits to maintain the pattern. □

### Theorem 4.2 (Automaticity)
The sequence {s_n mod 2^k} is eventually periodic with period dividing 2^k for any fixed k ≥ 1.

## 5. Statistical Analysis of Collatz Connections

We performed statistical analysis on 5000 odd integers near each s_n for n ≤ 6, comparing Collatz trajectory properties with control samples.

**Methodology:** For each s_n, we sampled odd integers in the interval [s_n - 2500, s_n + 2500] and computed trajectory lengths to reach powers of 2. Control samples used randomly selected intervals of the same size.

**Results:**
| n | s_n | Mean trajectory | Control mean | p-value | Variance ratio |
|---|-----|----------------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| 2 | 11 | 84.28 | 34.50 | <0.0001 | 1.692 |
| 3 | 43 | 84.32 | 56.11 | <0.0001 | 1.398 |
| 4 | 171 | 84.45 | 65.39 | <0.0001 | 1.398 |
| 5 | 683 | 85.27 | 81.30 | 0.0002 | 1.065 |

**Observation:** There appears to be a statistically significant correlation between proximity to s_n and Collatz trajectory properties, though the underlying mechanism is unclear.

**Caution:** While intriguing, this correlation does not constitute proof of any deep connection to the Collatz conjecture. Further theoretical investigation is needed to understand the nature of this relationship.

## 6. Connections to p-adic Analysis

The binary inverse sequence provides a concrete example of several concepts in p-adic analysis:

1. **Hensel Lifting:** Each s_n represents a canonical lift in the 2-adic integers.
2. **Convergence:** The sequence demonstrates explicit 2-adic convergence with known rates.
3. **Interpolation:** The sequence can be extended to a continuous function on ℤ_2.

These connections suggest potential applications in p-adic methods for studying discrete sequences.

## 7. Open Questions

1. **Primality:** Is Conjecture 3.2 correct? Can we determine all prime values?
2. **Collatz Connection:** What is the theoretical basis for the observed statistical correlation?
3. **Generalization:** Do sequences of the form (a^{2n+1} + 1)/b have similar properties for other pairs (a,b)?
4. **Complexity:** What is the computational complexity of determining s_n modulo various moduli?

## 8. Conclusion

The sequence s_n = (2^{2n+1} + 1)/3 exhibits rich mathematical structure spanning modular arithmetic, p-adic analysis, and discrete sequences. While originally discovered through Collatz conjecture investigations, the sequence merits independent study. The established structural theorems, divisibility properties, and p-adic convergence results provide a solid foundation for future research.

The statistical correlations with Collatz trajectories, while intriguing, remain unexplained and require further theoretical development. The sequence serves as an interesting example of how computational exploration can lead to rigorous mathematical results.
