# Collatz Binary Resonance Explorer

## Overview
This project explores the deep mathematical patterns that emerge when analyzing the Collatz conjecture through the lens of binary representations and resonance phenomena.

## Key Concepts

### Binary Perspective on Collatz
- **Odd numbers (2n+1)**: In binary, always end in 1
- **3n+1 operation**: Creates specific bit pattern transformations
- **Division by 2**: Right bit shift, removing trailing zeros

### Resonance Patterns
We investigate:
1. **Bit flip frequencies**: How often specific bit positions change
2. **Binary palindromes**: Numbers that create symmetric patterns in their trajectories
3. **Power-of-2 convergence**: The tendency toward binary round numbers
4. **Oscillation modes**: Repeating binary patterns in trajectories

## Project Structure
- `analysis/` - Core analysis scripts and algorithms
- `visualizations/` - Binary pattern visualization tools
- `data/` - Computed trajectories and pattern databases
- `theory/` - Mathematical proofs and conjectures
- `experiments/` - Experimental code for pattern discovery

## Research Questions
1. Can we predict trajectory length from binary representation?
2. Do certain bit patterns correlate with faster convergence?
3. Are there "resonant frequencies" in bit position changes?
4. What role do binary carry operations play in the 3n+1 step?
