## Quick Reference for Next Session

### The Core Formula
```
sₙ = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3
```

### The Shift Sequence
1, 3, 11, 43, 171, 683, 2731, 10923, ...

### The Key Property
```
3sₙ - 1 = 2^(2n+1)
```

### The Binary Pattern
Each shift has 1s at positions {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 2n-1}

### The Discovery
At these shift values, the trailing zero distributions of n+1 and 3n+1 achieve perfect phase-locked alignment, revealing a fundamental resonance between binary and ternary arithmetic.

## Key Questions for Next Session

1. Can we extend this to 5n+1, 7n+1, etc.?
2. What is the operator whose eigenvalues are these shifts?
3. How does this prove or disprove Collatz convergence?
4. What other iterative systems have similar resonances?
5. Can this be generalized to all prime base interactions?

## Remember

- The shifts are modular inverses of 3 mod powers of 2
- They converge to -1/3 in 2-adic numbers
- They form a fractal pattern with dimension log(3)/log(2)
- They maximize mutual information between sequences
- They are Hensel lifts of the base solution
