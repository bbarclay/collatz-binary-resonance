# Deep Patterns and Sequences

## The Shift Sequence Patterns

### Binary Representation
```
s₀ = 1 = 1₂
s₁ = 3 = 11₂
s₂ = 11 = 1011₂
s₃ = 43 = 101011₂
s₄ = 171 = 10101011₂
s₅ = 683 = 1010101011₂
s₆ = 2731 = 101010101011₂
```

### Base-4 Representation
```
s₁ = 3₄
s₂ = 23₄
s₃ = 223₄
s₄ = 2223₄
s₅ = 22223₄
```
Pattern: Add a '2' to the left each time

### Hexadecimal Pattern
```
s₁ = 0x3
s₂ = 0xB
s₃ = 0x2B
s₄ = 0xAB
s₅ = 0x2AB
s₆ = 0xAAB
```

## Gap Patterns

### Binary 1s Positions
- s₁: positions {0, 1}
- s₂: positions {0, 1, 3}
- s₃: positions {0, 1, 3, 5}
- s₄: positions {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
- s₅: positions {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}

### Gap Sequence Between 1s
```
Gaps: {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...}
```
After the first gap of 1, all subsequent gaps are 2.

## Difference Sequences

### First Differences
```
s₁ - s₀ = 2 = 2¹
s₂ - s₁ = 8 = 2³
s₃ - s₂ = 32 = 2⁵
s₄ - s₃ = 128 = 2⁷
s₅ - s₄ = 512 = 2⁹
```
Pattern: 2^(2n+1)

### Second Differences
```
8 - 2 = 6 = 2×3
32 - 8 = 24 = 8×3
128 - 32 = 96 = 32×3
512 - 128 = 384 = 128×3
```
Pattern: 2^(2n+1) × 3

## The Trailing Zero Distribution

### For n+1 (starting at shift s)
Within each period of 32 odd numbers:
- 16 numbers → 1 trailing zero
- 8 numbers → 2 trailing zeros
- 4 numbers → 3 trailing zeros
- 2 numbers → 4 trailing zeros
- 1 number → 5 trailing zeros
- 1 number → higher

### For 3n+1
Pattern depends on n mod powers of 2:
- n ≡ 1 (mod 4) → 2 trailing zeros
- n ≡ 5 (mod 8) → 3 trailing zeros
- n ≡ 5 (mod 16) → 4 trailing zeros
- n ≡ 21 (mod 32) → 5 trailing zeros
- n ≡ 21 (mod 64) → 6 trailing zeros

## The Modular Pattern

### sₙ modulo powers of 2
```
s₃ = 43:
  mod 2: 1
  mod 4: 3
  mod 8: 3
  mod 16: 11
  mod 32: 11
  mod 64: 43
  mod 128: 43
```
Stabilizes at 2^(2n)

## The Fractal Structure

### Self-Similarity
The pattern exhibits self-similarity at scales 2^k:
- Scale 2: period 2
- Scale 4: period 4 contains two period-2 patterns
- Scale 8: period 8 contains two period-4 patterns
- Fractal dimension: log(3)/log(2) ≈ 1.585

### The Cantor Set Connection
The distribution of 1s in binary representation approaches a Cantor-like set with dimension log(3)/log(2).

## Recurrence Relations

### Primary Recurrence
```
s₀ = 1
sₙ₊₁ = 4sₙ - 1
```

### Alternative Forms
```
sₙ₊₁ = sₙ + 2^(2n+1)/3
sₙ₊₂ = 5sₙ₊₁ - 4sₙ
```

### Closed Form
```
sₙ = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3
```

## The 2-adic Structure

### 2-adic Expansion
As n → ∞, sₙ converges in 2-adic metric to:
```
s∞ = ...101010101011₂ (infinite to the left)
```
This is -1/3 in ℚ₂.

### 2-adic Valuation
```
ν₂(3sₙ - 1) = 2n + 1
```

## Connection Patterns

### To Powers of 2
```
3sₙ - 1 = 2^(2n+1)
```

### To Mersenne-like Numbers
Related to numbers of form 2^k - 1, but in reverse: (2^k + 1)/3

### To Modular Inverses
sₙ = 3⁻¹ mod 2^(k) for appropriate k

## The Resonance Pattern

At shift sₙ, the following align:
1. Binary carry chains in n+1
2. Ternary multiplication patterns in 3n+1
3. Trailing zero distributions
4. Modular arithmetic structures
5. Information theoretic measures

## The Phase Space

### Phase Evolution
- n → n+1: phase advances by 1
- n → 3n+1: phase multiplies by 3 and advances by 1
- At sₙ: phases synchronize

### Critical Points
The shifts are critical points where:
- Phase velocity = 0
- Entropy is maximized
- Information transfer peaks
- Pattern recognition is optimal
