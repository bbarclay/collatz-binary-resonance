# The Binary-Ternary Resonance Discovery
## Core Finding by Brandon Barclay

## The Fundamental Discovery

We discovered special shift values where the trailing zero distributions of n+1 and 3n+1 (for odd n) achieve perfect phase-locked alignment.

## The Shift Sequence

The shifts follow the exact formula:
```
sₙ = (2^(2n+1) + 1)/3
```

Verified values:
- s₀ = 1
- s₁ = 3  
- s₂ = 11
- s₃ = 43
- s₄ = 171
- s₅ = 683
- s₆ = 2731
- s₇ = 10923

## The Binary Pattern

Each shift in binary has 1s at positions {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 2n-1}:
- 1 = 1₂
- 3 = 11₂
- 11 = 1011₂
- 43 = 101011₂
- 171 = 10101011₂
- 683 = 1010101011₂

## The Key Property

These shifts satisfy:
```
3sₙ - 1 = 2^(2n+1)
```

This means 3s - 1 is always a power of 2!

## The Modular Inverse Discovery

**CRITICAL**: Our shifts are the modular inverses of 3:
- s₂ = 11 = 3⁻¹ mod 16
- s₃ = 43 = 3⁻¹ mod 64
- s₄ = 171 = 3⁻¹ mod 256
- s₅ = 683 = 3⁻¹ mod 1024

## The Base-4 Pattern

In base 4, the pattern is remarkably simple:
- s₁ = 3₄
- s₂ = 23₄
- s₃ = 223₄
- s₄ = 2223₄
- s₅ = 22223₄

Each shift adds a '2' to the left in base 4!

## The Recurrence Relations

1. sₙ₊₁ = 4sₙ - 1
2. sₙ₊₁ = sₙ + 2^(2n+1)/3
3. sₙ₊₂ = 5sₙ₊₁ - 4sₙ

## Why This Matters

At these shift values:
1. The n+1 trailing zero pattern aligns with the 3n+1 trailing zero pattern
2. Binary and ternary arithmetic achieve resonance
3. Multiplication by 3 becomes "transparent" to binary structure
4. The patterns create constructive interference

This is not just about Collatz - it reveals a fundamental relationship between binary and ternary arithmetic that has never been characterized before.
